You can download example dataset (10k PBMC cells from 10x genomics) from https://artyomovlab.wustl.edu/sce/var/datasets/PBMC_10k/files/PBMC_10k.zip.

This file contains all necessary example files (`dataset.json`, `plot_data.json`, `exp_data.json`, `data.h5`, `markers.json` and also contains `files` folder).

You can use this dataset to check the file structure of JSON files or just to check if you installed SCE correctly.
